            Sachertorte is a famous Viennese cake. <br><br>

            It is the most famous chocolate cake in the world. <br><br>

            Sachertorte was invented by Austrian Franz Sacher in 1832 for Prince Wenzel von Metternich in Vienna, Austria. <br><br>

            The sweet masterpiece consists of 3 layers of chocolate sponge cake with thickly spread apricot jam in between and on the top. The whole cake is covered in dark chocolate icing. It is traditionally served with unsweetened whipped cream on the side. <br><br>

            In 1832, Prince Wenzel von Metternich charged his personal chef with creating a special dessert for several important guests. The head chef, having taken ill, let the task fall to his sixteen-year-old apprentice, Franz Sacher, then in his second year of training in Metternich’s kitchen. The Prince is reported to have declared: “Let there be no shame on me tonight!” While the torte created by Sacher on this occasion is said to have delighted Metternich’s guests, the dessert received no immediate further attention. <br><br>

            Franz Sacher [photo below] completed his training as a chef and afterward spent time in Bratislava and Budapest, ultimately settling in his hometown of Vienna, where he opened a specialty delicatessen and wine shop. <br><br>

            Sacher’s eldest son Eduard carried on his father’s culinary legacy, completing his own training in Vienna with the Royal and Imperial Pastry Chef at the Demel bakery and chocolatier, during which time he perfected his father’s recipe and developed the torte into its current form. <br><br>

            In 1876, Eduard Sacher opens an exclusive luxury hotel in the heart of Vienna by the name of Sacher [photo below]. The cake of the same name becomes the hallmark of the house. Since then, the cake remains among the most famous of Vienna’s culinary specialties.

            In the early decades of the 20th century, a legal battle over the use of the label “The Original Sacher Torte” developed between the Hotel Sacher and the Demel bakery. Eduard Sacher completed his recipe for Sacher Torte while working at Demel, which was the first establishment to offer the “Original Sachertorte” cake. After the death of Eduard’s widow Anna in 1930, followed by the bankruptcy of the Hotel Sacher in 1934, Eduard Sacher’s son (also named Eduard Sacher) found employment at Demel and brought to the bakery the sole distribution right for an Eduard-Sacher-Torte. <br><br>

            However, eventually an out-of-court settlement was agreed, under which the use of the label “The Original Sacher Torte” went to Hotel Sacher and  the Demel got the rights to decorate its tortes with a triangular seal that reads “Eduard-Sacher-Torte.” <br><br>

        <p>
            As the years have progressed, this has given Hotel Sacher a massive branding advantage over Demel, helping it to be able to sell both more cakes, and at a higher price. <br><br>

            Hotel Sacher’s “Original Sacher Torte” is sold at the Vienna and Salzburg locations of the Hotel Sacher, at Cafe Sacher branches in Innsbruck and Graz, at the Sacher Shop in Bolzano, in the Duty Free area of Vienna airport, and via the Hotel Sacher’s online shop.

            The Original Sacher Torte is still made almost entirely by hand using Franz Sacher’s recipe and the exact composition is a closely guarded secret. More than 360,000 cakes a year are made in Vienna by its 41 employees, many of which are shipped all over the world allowing a “taste of Vienna” to be delivered to many far away places. The most popular destinations for its cakes are Germany, Italy, France, the US, and many countries in Asia. <br><br>

            Today, Sachertorte stands as one of Vienna’s best-known symbols. <br><br>

            December 5th is National Sachertorte Day in the United States.

        <ul>
            <li>4 1/2 ounces high-quality bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
            <li>9 tablespoons (1 stick plus 1 tablespoon) unsalted butter, at cool room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>6 large eggs, separated, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (spoon gently into cup and level top)</li>
            <li>1 cup Apricot Glaze</li>
            <li>Small Batch Chocolate Glaze</li>
            <li>Sweetened Whipped Cream , for serving</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h1>Steps</h1>
    
        <ol>
            <li>To make the torte: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400°F. Lightly butter a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with a round of parchment or wax paper. Dust the sides of the pan with flour and tap out the excess.</li>
            <li>In the top part of a double boiler over very hot, but not simmering, water, or in a microwave at medium power, melt the chocolate. Remove from the heat or the oven, and let stand, stirring often, until cool.</li>
            <li>Beat the butter in the bowl of a eavy-duty standing mixer fitted with the paddle blade on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 inute. On low speed, beat in the confectioners' sugar. Return the speed to medium-high and beat until light in color and texture, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks, one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the chocolate and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg whites and granulated sugar in a large bowl with a handheld electric mixer on high speed just until they form soft, shiny peaks. Do not overbeat. Stir about one fourth of the beaten whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it, then fold in the remaining whites, leaving a few visible wisps of whites. Sift half of the flour over the chocolate mixture, and fold in with a large balloon whisk or rubber spatula. Repeat with the remaining flour.</li>
            <li>Spread evenly in the pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. (The cake will dome in the center.) Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove the sides of the pan, and invert the cake onto the rack. Remove the paper and reinvert on another rack to turn right side up. Cool completely.</li>
            <li>To assemble: Using a long serrated knife, trim the top of the cake to make it level. Cut the cake horizontally into two equal layers. Place one cake layer on an 8-inch cardboard round. Brush the top of the cake layer with the apricot glaze. Place the second cake layer on top and brush again. Brush the top and sides of the cake with the remaining glaze. Transfer the cake to a wire rack placed over a jelly-roll pan lined with waxed paper. Let cool until the glaze is set.</li>
            <li>Make the chocolate glaze (it must be freshly made and warm). Pour all of the warm chocolate glaze on top of the cake. Using a metal offset spatula, gently smooth the glaze over the cake, allowing it to run down the sides, being sure that the glaze completely coats the cake (patch any bare spots with the spatula and the icing that has dripped). Cool until the glaze is barely set, then transfer the cake to a serving plate. Refrigerate until the glaze is completely set, at least 1 hour. Remove the cake from the refrigerator about 1 hour before serving.</li>
            <li>To serve, slice with a sharp knife dipped into hot water. Serve with a large dollop of whipped cream on the side.</li>
