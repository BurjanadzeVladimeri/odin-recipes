        Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other ingredients and formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked. <br><br>

        It is the epitome of an all-American comfort food. <br><br>

        Meatloaf is usually made with ground beef, although ground lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry and seafood are also used, sometimes in combination. Vegetarian adaptations of meatloaf may use imitation meat or pulses. <br><br>

        A meat is mixed with seasonings like onions, herbs, or ketchup, bound with eggs or breadcrumbs, formed into a loaf shape and then baked. <br><br>

        After meatloaf is baked for around forty minutes, it is usually topped with some sort of sauce, usually tomato. Other variations top meatloaf with brown gravy or barbeque sauce. <br><br>

        The cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions. It can easily become dry – therefore, various techniques exist to keep the dish moist, like mixing in breadcrumbs and egg, covering it with sauce, wrapping it, or using moisture-enhancing ingredients in the mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats, rich cheeses, or vegetables. <br><br>

        Meatloaf of minced meat was mentioned in the Roman cookery collection Apicius as early as the 5th century. The recipe includes a primitive recipe for meat, bread and wine patties that used local herbs and spices to flavour the meat before baking. However, unlike contemporary meatloafs, the Roman recipe called for cooked animal brains. It’s not surprising that a few adjustments have been made to the dish over the years. <br><br>

        After its introduction in Ancient Rome, the meatloaf spread to all corners of Europe. While many countries produced their own variants on the dish, it was in Germany and Scandinavia that the recipe really found its true calling. In Sweden, meatloaf became known as köttfärslimpa, and was often served with either mashed or boiled potatoes, whereas the Germans would often stuff their variant with hard boiled eggs. <br><br>

        American meatloaf has its origins in scrapple, a mixture of ground pork and cornmeal served by German-Americans in Pennsylvania since colonial times. <br><br>

        The first modern American meatloaf recipe, consisting of chopped beef, salt, pepper, onions, milk-soaked bread and eggs first appeared in 1870s. However, instead of being the dinner classic we know today, it was originally meant to be a breakfast option. <br><br>
